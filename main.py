Here is the reason why without parenthesis ðŸ‘‡

screen.onkey(key = "space", fun = move_forward()) 
screen.onkey(key = "space", fun = move_forward) 

When you pass a function to another function (such as setting up an event listener), you generally pass the function's 
name without parentheses to provide a reference to the function itself. This allows the function to be called later in 
response to an event, rather than being called immediately when the program runs.

This concept is a crucial part of event-driven programming, which is commonly used in graphical user interfaces (GUIs) 
and game development.
"""
# Another explanation
"""
Functions as Input 

def function_a(something):
    #Do this with something
    #Then do this 
    #Finally do this 
    
def function_b():
    #Do this
    
function_a(function_b)

So notice that when we pass a function as an input,
we only pass the name without the parenthesis in the end
